### Compiling from source

To compile from source use the script file with the format your operating system supports.

| OS      | File Name |
| ------- | --------- |
| Linux   | `run.sh`  |
| Windows | `run.bat` |

These scripts compile the project.
In case you are getting compilation errors, check that your JDK version is up-to-date.
The version for this project is `21`.

The scripts will compile and run the program.
Afterwards you will find the `.jar` file inside the projects root directory.
